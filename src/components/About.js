        Welcome to Forage, the one place where you can find inspiring recipes to avoid food waste and maximize ingredients in your fridge. Ask yourself, have you ever
        came home from work or a busy day and didn't know what to cook? Let's say once you have an idea of what to cook you realize that you are missing specific ingredients
        that go with that recipe and a trip to the supermarket is out of the question. Well look no further as this website will help with that dilemma. It is a simple as just
        typing in the ingredients of what you currently have and the site will start showing you recipes that can be made. Furthermore the site takes into account any dietary 
        restrictions that you input into the "FILTER HERE" drop down menu so that the recipes are more targeted to your needs. Lastly this site also gives you the ability to favorite
        the recipes that are shown by clicking the star above the picture as well as giving you the option to create/add recipes by pressing the "Add A RECIPE" tab. We hope that you
        enjoy using "Forage" to the fullest extent and that it provides a more positive, environmentally friendly, and cost affective solution to your kitchen.
